# spaceships2dUnity
A ship editor and booster navigation in unity.

The editor is based on 2d physics while navigation uses lpsolve from kerbcom's unity library.

Use ctrl+alt to rotate or resize the selected piece in the editor.

Use debug mode for navigation to see the direction the boosters are firing.

For licensing see http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/FAQ.htm

I started working on this but it became too complicated so I'm just releasing what I have.
